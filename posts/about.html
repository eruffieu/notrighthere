You may wonder why baker and pastry cook follow software engineer, well it's a long story. When I was younger, I used to like video games and computer stuff, so my wish was to be software engineer so I could create awesome things and amaze people the way I was amazed by this "magic thing" that the computer was. I think I was good enough at school to do big and long studies that could lead me to achieve this, however I wasn't really sure about how usefull it was for me to learn what is an icosahedron, to learn how to dissect a frog, or to know how the ancient greeks lived. So at the age of 16, I decided to stop learning these things and go straight to work so I started studying bakery. 3 weeks at work, 1 week at school every month. The labor was hard, especially the work schedules (4am to 1pm, wednesday to sunday), but it allowed me to rent my first flat : finally some liberty. Two years later I graduated and decided to learn pastry, hoping I would like it more. I graduated quite easily but I came to the conclusion that these works are reserved to passionate people, and I wasn't. Always secretly hoping to be software engineer one day, I found my first real work (without any school) as a baker at the age of 20. I worked there for 3 years, nothing much to say about this work, every day was the same and the labor was not really interesting.<br/> Then one day, I heard about a school which claimed to make you software engineer in 3 years, where you learn only code, and which is also free. <a href="http://www.42.fr" target="_blank">42</a>. So in november 2014 I left my job to study there, and in march 2017 I was the third to <a href="https://companies.intra.42.fr/fr/curriculums/eruffieu" target="_blank">graduate</a> in the thousand students who started at the same time than me, and the 27th in the entire school. I finally am software engineer and I finally like to learn what a icosahedron is (I still don't really care about the frog however).<br/>Since my graduation, I started working at <a href="http://www.tempow.com" target="_blank">Tempow</a>, I continue to learn things doing what I like, and now I am happy.<br/>
